# "QUOTER"

## Group project to create an Interactive Full-Stack Application that allows users to communicate their thoughts, feelings, inspirations and more by posting famous (or infamous) quotes for other users to read and respond to with another quote!

Our team’s motivation was to bring something focused and fun to social media using the latest learnings from this Bootcamp, including JavaScript, Handlebars, CSS and MySQL as the core technologies.  
 
We built this project, in part, to showcase our understanding of the above technologies as well as utilizing Heroku, Insomnia and a deeper use of GitHub for help in assigning different roles, branching, and version control.

This application solves the problem of using a templating tool and integrating it with other technologies with which we are more familiar, including (but not limited to) "back-end" JavaScript, as well as a MySQL database.

In this project, we learned a lot from challenges and successes. Challenges included working with a newly introduced technology, Handlebars, and integrating it into a complex, interactive application connected to a database. Successes included working well as a team. Our responsibilities, although somewhat flexible, were clear. We were able to use GitHub effectively for branching and version control. Most importantly, each of us worked from our “coding-related” and interpersonal strengths.
